# Simon
Simon, the Drawer-er
-----
Instantiates random Objects (as opposed to Random objects).
Earlier implementations have been used in the industry to generate mock-data, including images, for PDF forms.
The algorithm was previously called variations on RandomInstantiator, RandomObjectInstantiator and RandomObjectsOfUnusualInstantiation, but was renamed to Simon once the image-generation module produced "interesting" results.
The new name is a tribute to a [certain character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqmrQKUGrH4&list=PLS_gQd8UB-hJ3f5OZ7JkMpQti72Cgmp0J).
This is the third implementation; it uses AspectJ to prevent infinite recursion loops.
