# Simon
Simon, the Drawer-er

# Description
Instantiates random Objects (as opposed to Random objects).
Selects a random (sub-)class, a random Constructor and random parameters.
Handles corner-cases, such as enums, singletons, factory methods, etc.

Simon is a simple concept: select a random or arbitrary type, and then construct an instance of that type with randomly- or arbitrarily-selected parameters. In this way, Simon is very powerful, as it can create literally anything.

However, we can increase Simon's results' relevance to a particular domain by building on top of the Simon engine layers which will reduce the cardinality of the set of Simon's possible return values. That is, domain-specialization is what makes Simon able to produce "better" results more often.

# Applications

Security
Simon can be used to enhance your security model. Programmers need specifications as well as sample input and output data. However, that data can be sensitive (e.g., medical) or classified (e.g., military), causing a bureaucratic delay. Instead of sharing real data with your subcontractors, you can share *realistic* data with them.

Entertainment and Gaming
Games and engines which have an API can have Simon generate randomized maps, characters and monsters, etc.

The Arts
Simon can be used as a Creativity Assistant, producing a continuous stream of new ideas that are completely unencumbered by licensing, copyrights and patents, etc: the Simon software is in the public domain and the output produced when you run Simon is yours.

# History
Earlier implementations have been used in the industry to generate mock-data, including images, for PDF forms.
The algorithm was previously called variations on RandomInstantiator, RandomObjectInstantiator and RandomObjectsOfUnusualInstantiation, but was renamed to Simon, the Drawer-er, once the image-generation module produced "interesting" results.
The new name is a tribute to a [certain character](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqmrQKUGrH4&list=PLS_gQd8UB-hJ3f5OZ7JkMpQti72Cgmp0J).
This is the third implementation; it uses AspectJ to prevent infinite recursion loops.

# Future
We will be creating an app that will build statistical models given a stream of arbitrary objects, and then use those models' statistical distributions in place of Simon's core engine's uniformly-distributed PRNG.

We will leverage machine-learning technology to filter Simon's output, in order to increase the likelihood that Simon will give you the results you want ;)
